// bindBareNameScopeRefs rewrites `unresolved::<bareName>` edges whose
// source is inside a function scope (or IS a function) onto the
// matching KindLocal / KindParam node that the enclosing function
// declares. Pre-#77 there was nothing to bind to — locals were
// edge-endpoint-only — so the resolver always fell through to
// `unresolved::*`. With #77's KindLocal materialisation the scope is
// now first-class and we can do the bind.
//
// Two precedence rules govern the choice when more than one candidate
// matches the name:
//
//  1. KindLocal beats KindParam — Go shadowing semantics, a local
//     declared with the same name as a parameter takes over from its
//     declaration line onwards.
//  2. Among KindLocal candidates the most recently declared one before
//     the reference line wins (the standard "last shadow in scope"
//     rule). The edge's Line field is the reference site; we filter
//     candidates to StartLine <= reference line and pick the maximum
//     StartLine.
//
// Ambiguous cases that don't resolve to one winner (e.g. two locals
// with the same Name on the same StartLine, or no candidate before
// the reference line) are left untouched so the downstream `unresolved`
// audit can still surface them.
//
// Scope today is Go-only — TypeScript / Python don't materialise
// locals yet, so their unresolved bare-name edges have no candidate
// to bind to. The pass naturally degenerates to a no-op for those
// languages because the candidate index will be empty for their
// owners.
