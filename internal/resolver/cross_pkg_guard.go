// Cross-package name-match guard.
//
// The heuristic cascade in resolveFunctionCall / resolveMethodCall ends,
// for calls it can't pin precisely, in a name-only fallback: "the first
// function/method named X in the caller's repo". When the only candidate
// of that name lives in a package the caller never imports, that
// fallback manufactures a false `calls` edge — a JS/TS factory result
// `h.handle()` binding to an unrelated `handle`, or a `ns.foo()`
// namespace call binding to a free `foo` in some other module.
//
// This guard runs once after the main resolution pass. For every edge
// the pass resolved at one of the two weakest confidence tiers
// (text_matched / ast_inferred) it asks a single question: is the
// resolved target import-reachable from the call site? Reachable means
// the target sits in the caller's own directory (same package) or in a
// directory the caller's file imports. When it is not, the edge is
// reverted to its pre-resolution `unresolved::` target so a
// higher-evidence resolver (CrossRepoResolver, or a later LSP-backed
// pass) can have a clean attempt instead of inheriting a wrong binding.
//
// Genuine same-package and imported-target edges are never touched: the
// reachability set always contains the caller's own directory, and an
// imported package contributes its directory to the set. Edges resolved
// at ast_resolved or above are out of scope — those carry structural or
// compiler-grade evidence the name-only fallback never had.

// guardCrossPackageCallEdges inspects the edges mutated by the just-
// completed resolution pass and reverts any weak-tier call/reference
// edge whose resolved target is not import-reachable from the caller.
// jobs are the reindexJob records produced by ResolveAll's worker
// phase; each carries the edge's pre-resolution target in oldTo, so a
// reverted edge is restored exactly. closure is the import-reachability
// map from buildImportClosure. Returns the number of edges reverted.
